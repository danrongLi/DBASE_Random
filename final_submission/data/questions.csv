1294,1,Allocate Mailboxes,"Given the array houses and an integer k. where houses i is the location of the ith house along a street, your task is to allocate k mailboxes in the street. Return the minimum total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox."
1295,1,Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits,"Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits."
1948,3,Delete Duplicate Folders in System,"Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.
